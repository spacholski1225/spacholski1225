## 🧠 Backend Engineering with AI Enablement

I'm a backend engineer focused on building scalable, production-grade systems — with a strong interest in **AI-native features** and **developer tooling**.  
I mostly work with .NET, TypeScript, and AWS, applying clean architecture and strong observability practices.

A big part of my work involves building **AI-augmented tools** for engineering teams — such as an internal PR reviewer powered by LLMs and context from GitHub, JIRA, and logs. I also help drive AI adoption within the company through tooling, onboarding, and systems integration.

## 🔍 Systems I've Built

| System | Description | Stack | AI Integration |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| PR Reviewer | Enhances GitHub PRs with context-aware AI reviews | TypeScript, GitHub API, JIRA | OpenAI, embeddings |
| RAG for Docs | Internal search across Confluence, GitHub, and JIRA | AWS Lambda, PostgreSQL | Claude, Bedrock |
| AAC Assistant | Communication tool for non-verbal users with autism | .NET 8, Razor Pages, AWS | OpenAI |
| Microservice Template | Production-ready infra template for backend teams | TeamCity, Docker, Terraform | – |

These tools are used across multiple services and teams internally — from CI/CD pipelines to day-to-day developer workflows.

## 🧠 How I Approach AI System Design

- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines with context routing & caching  
- Tool-using LLM agents for automation & orchestration  
- Semantic search using Qdrant and embedding-based retrieval  
- Context-aware completions for engineering tools (e.g. PR reviewers, JIRA enrichment)  
- Resilience via retries, circuit breakers & observability  
- Composable prompts with role-specific scaffolds

## ⚡ What I Care About

- AI features should feel like **tools**, not magic — latency, fallback, and traceability matter.
- AI-enhanced workflows should **augment developers**, not get in their way.
- Clean, composable systems scale better — for both humans and machines.
